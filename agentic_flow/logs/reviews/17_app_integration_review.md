- Task 14 (TodoList) ✅ - Refactored to props-driven architecture
- Task 13 (API Service) ✅ - All CRUD functions imported and utilized

---

## Integration Quality Evaluation

### ✅ Excellent Component Architecture
**Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns with App as main controller
- **App Component**: Global state management and API orchestration
- **TodoForm**: Focused on input collection with callback communication
- **TodoList**: Props-driven display container with TodoItem composition
- **TodoItem**: Individual todo rendering and interactions

### ✅ Outstanding State Management
**Global State Design**: Three-tier state management
```javascript
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);        // Application data
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);  // UI state
const [error, setError] = useState(null);      // Error state
```

**State Update Patterns**: Proper React patterns implemented
- Immutable updates using spread operator
- Functional updates with prevTodos pattern
- No mutation of state objects

### ✅ Robust API Integration
**CRUD Operations**: All operations properly implemented
- **Create**: `handleAddTodo` → `createTodo` → state update
- **Read**: `loadTodos` → `getTodos` → initial state population
- **Update**: `handleToggleTodo` → `updateTodo` → selective state update
- **Delete**: `handleDeleteTodo` → `deleteTodo` → filtered state update

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- Individual operation error handling with try-catch
- Global error state for initialization failures
- Error propagation to components for user feedback
- Retry functionality for failed operations

---

## Application Architecture Analysis

### ✅ Component Communication Excellence
**Data Flow (Props Down)**:
```
App (global state)
├── TodoForm (onAddTodo callback)
└── TodoList (todos, onToggle, onDelete)
    └── TodoItem (todo, onToggle, onDelete)
```

**Action Flow (Callbacks Up)**:
```
TodoForm → handleAddTodo → API → state update
TodoItem → TodoList → App handlers → API → state update
```

### ✅ TodoList Refactoring Success
**Architecture Transformation**: Excellent refactoring from self-contained to props-driven
- **Before**: Internal state management with useEffect, API calls
- **After**: Clean props-driven component with TodoItem integration
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, better testability, cleaner separation

### ✅ Application Structure
**Semantic Layout**: Proper HTML5 semantic structure
```html
<div className="App">
  <header className="App-header">     <!-- Application branding -->
  <main className="App-main">         <!-- Main functionality -->
    <section className="todo-form-section">   <!-- Input section -->
    <section className="todo-list-section">   <!-- Display section -->
  <footer className="App-footer">     <!-- Application info -->
```

**Todo Display**: Dynamic list rendering
- Initial load → loading state → data display → empty state handling

**Todo Toggle**: Seamless completion toggling
- Click → optimistic update → API call → state synchronization

**Todo Deletion**: Clean removal process  
- Delete action → API call → state filtering → UI update

### ✅ User Experience Features
**Loading States**: Professional loading indicators
- Initial app load with loading message
- Loading state management during operations
