# 001 Architecture and Tasks Review - Architect B
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Reviewer**: Architect B  
**Status**: NOT APPROVED

## Architecture Review (docs/design/architecture.md)

### Strengths
- Clear directory structure
- Proper separation of backend/frontend concerns
- RESTful API design approach

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Error Handling Strategy**: No plan for API errors, validation failures
2. **No Testing Strategy**: Architecture lacks testing approach for both backend and frontend
3. **Environment Configuration Missing**: No mention of development vs production configs
4. **CORS Configuration Incomplete**: Needs specific configuration details
5. **Data Persistence Gap**: In-memory storage limitation not addressed

### Recommendations for Architecture
- Add error handling and validation section
- Include testing strategy (unit, integration)
- Specify environment configuration approach
- Add logging and monitoring considerations

## Task Breakdown Review (docs/design/tasks.yaml)

### Critical Atomicity Violations

#### Task 03 - "api_routes" 
**Problem**: Bundles ALL CRUD endpoints into single task
**Fix Required**: Split into:
- 03a: GET /api/todos endpoint only
- 03b: POST /api/todos endpoint only  
- 03c: PUT /api/todos/{id} endpoint only
- 03d: DELETE /api/todos/{id} endpoint only

#### Task 07 - "todo_components"
**Problem**: Creates multiple components in one task
**Fix Required**: Split into:
- 07a: TodoList component only
- 07b: TodoItem component only
- 07c: TodoForm component only

### Missing Tasks
1. **Backend testing setup** - pytest configuration
2. **Frontend testing setup** - Jest/React Testing Library
3. **Error handling implementation** - API error responses
4. **Environment configuration** - Flask config management
5. **Development server setup** - Running instructions

### Task Definition Issues
- Tasks lack clear success criteria
- No mention of testing requirements per task
- Dependencies between tasks not specified
- Some deliverables too vague ("basic setup")

## Required Changes

### For Architecture.md
1. Add error handling and validation strategy
2. Include testing approach section
3. Specify environment configuration
4. Add deployment considerations

### For tasks.yaml  
1. Split multi-deliverable tasks into atomic units
2. Add missing infrastructure tasks
3. Define clear success criteria for each task
4. Specify task dependencies
5. Include testing requirements per task

## Verdict: NOT APPROVED

Both files require significant revision to meet atomicity and completeness requirements. Each task must represent the smallest possible unit of work that can be independently implemented and tested.

**Next Step**: Architect A must address all feedback and resubmit both files for re-review.
