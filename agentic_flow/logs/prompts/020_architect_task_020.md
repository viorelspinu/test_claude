**Context**: Task 19 (basic_styling) successfully completed and approved

## Situation Assessment

Task 19 has been successfully completed with exceptional quality. The basic styling implementation achieved:

Remaining tasks: Task 20 only

## Next Task Selection

**Selected Task**: 20 - integration_test

### Task 20: Final Integration Testing

**Objective**: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of complete Flask + React todo application

**Rationale**: 
- This is the final task in our approved task sequence
- All individual components are implemented and tested
- Integration testing ensures the complete application works end-to-end
- Validates the entire Flask backend + React frontend architecture
- Confirms all CRUD operations work through the full stack
- Final verification before project completion

**Scope**:
- Test complete application workflow (create, read, update, delete todos)
- Verify Flask backend and React frontend integration
- Test error handling across the full stack
- Validate responsive design and user experience
- Confirm API communication and data flow
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

**Dependencies**: All previous tasks (1-19) completed ✅

**Risk Level**: Low - all components individually tested and approved

This represents the final phase of our development cycle, completing the full-stack todo application as specified in the original requirements.
