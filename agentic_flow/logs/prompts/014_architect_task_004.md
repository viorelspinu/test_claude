**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Role**: Architect A selecting next task for execution

## Task Selection Decision
Selected Task 04: `storage_functions` - Create in-memory storage functions for todos

## Rationale
- Depends on Task 03 (todo_model) which is completed and approved
- Next logical step in data layer development
- Required before any API endpoints can function
- Atomic task with single deliverable: storage functions
