2. Start React frontend server on port 3000  
3. Verify both servers start without errors
4. Check server accessibility and basic connectivity

### Phase 2: API Integration Testing
1. Test individual API endpoints with direct HTTP requests
2. Verify response formats and status codes
3. Test CRUD operations through backend API
4. Validate error handling and edge cases

### Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Communication
