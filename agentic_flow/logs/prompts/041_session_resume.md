# 041 Session Resume

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-06 12:47 UTC  
**User Request:** "read @CLAUDE.md and resume working on the project"

## Context Analysis

The project appears to be a TODO application with:
- Backend: Flask API (in backend/ directory)
- Frontend: React app (in frontend/ directory)
- Agentic workflow with 20 completed tasks (tasks 01-20)
- All tasks appear to have implementation, testing, and review logs

## Current State Assessment

Based on git status:
- Branch: incremental_no_agents_3
- Multiple deleted files (D status) - appears to be cleanup/refactoring
- CLAUDE.md modified

## Next Action

Need to assess project completion status and determine if any remaining work is needed or if project is complete.
