# Prompt 13: Architect A - Task Selection
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Role**: Architect A  
**Action**: Select next task from approved tasks.yaml  

## Context
- Task 12 (react_app_init) successfully completed and reviewed  
- Frontend foundation ready: React 19.1.0 with CRA setup
- All backend infrastructure complete (Tasks 01-11)
- Frontend development phase beginning

## Current Project State
- Backend: Complete Flask API with CRUD operations, error handling, testing
- Frontend: React app initialized, ready for component development
- Next phase: Frontend components and integration

## Task Selection Decision
Selecting **Task 13: api_service** from approved tasks.yaml

### Rationale
1. **Dependency order**: Task 13 has no frontend dependencies beyond React setup (Task 12 ✅)
2. **Foundation first**: API service layer needed before any components can communicate with backend
3. **Atomic scope**: Single deliverable - API service layer for backend communication
4. **Risk mitigation**: Establishes data layer early to catch integration issues

## Selected Task Details
- **ID**: 13  
- **Name**: api_service
- **Objective**: Create API service layer for backend communication
- **Deliverable**: src/services/api.js with complete CRUD operations
- **Dependencies**: Task 12 ✅ (React app initialized)

## Next Action
Proceed to Developer implementation of Task 13.
