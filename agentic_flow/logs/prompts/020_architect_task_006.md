# 020 Architect Task 06 Selection
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Role**: Architect A selecting next task for execution

## Task Selection Decision
Selected Task 06: `post_todos_endpoint` - Implement POST /api/todos endpoint only

## Rationale
- Depends on Task 05 (get_todos_endpoint) which is completed and approved
- Next logical CRUD operation in sequence
- Atomic task implementing single HTTP method
- Builds on existing Blueprint structure
