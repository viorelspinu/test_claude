# 045 UI Issue Feedback

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-06 12:47 UTC  
**User Feedback:** "really????? 80% of my page is header!!!!"

## Issue Identified
The header section is taking up too much vertical space, leaving insufficient room for the actual todo functionality. This creates poor user experience with wasted screen real estate.

## Problem Assessment
- Header appears to be consuming ~80% of viewport height
- Todo form and list pushed to bottom of page
- Poor visual hierarchy and space utilization

## Next Action
Fix CSS styling to reduce header size and improve layout proportions.
