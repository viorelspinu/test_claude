# 026 Architect Task 08 Selection
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Role**: Architect A selecting next task for execution

## Task Selection Decision
Selected Task 08: `delete_todos_endpoint` - Implement DELETE /api/todos/{id} endpoint only

## Rationale
- Depends on Task 07 (put_todos_endpoint) which is completed and approved
- Final CRUD operation in sequence (Create → Read → Update → Delete)
- Atomic task implementing single HTTP method
- Completes the backend API layer for todo management
