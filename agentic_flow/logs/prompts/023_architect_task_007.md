# 023 Architect Task 07 Selection
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-23 (estimated)  
**Role**: Architect A selecting next task for execution

## Task Selection Decision
Selected Task 07: `put_todos_endpoint` - Implement PUT /api/todos/{id} endpoint only

## Rationale
- Depends on Task 06 (post_todos_endpoint) which is completed and approved
- Next CRUD operation in sequence (Create → Read → Update)
- Atomic task implementing single HTTP method with ID parameter
- Builds on existing validation patterns from POST endpoint
