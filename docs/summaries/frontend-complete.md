- Includes search functionality
- Shows task statistics and progress
- Handles loading, error, and empty states gracefully
- Features:
  - Real-time filtering by status and priority
  - Search across task titles and descriptions
  - Sort by creation date, update date, title, or priority
  - Toggle between list and grid views

#### TaskItem Component (`/frontend/src/components/Task/TaskItem.js`)
- Renders individual task with all details
- Supports task completion toggle
- Inline editing capabilities
- Delete confirmation modal
- Shows priority badges and status indicators
- Displays timestamps with relative time formatting
- Expandable descriptions for long text

#### TaskForm Component (`/frontend/src/components/Task/TaskForm.js`)
- Handles both task creation and editing
- Real-time form validation
- Character count indicators
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessible form controls
- Priority selection dropdown

### 2. API Integration
Successfully connected all components to Flask API using proper HTTP methods:

#### API Client (`/frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- Base API client with automatic error handling
- Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Custom ApiError class for error categorization
- Network error detection and handling
- Configured to use backend at `http://localhost:5001/api`

#### Task Service (`/frontend/src/services/taskService.js`)
- Implements all CRUD operations following API contract
- Input validation before API calls
- Specialized methods for filtering and searching
- Bulk operations support
- Statistics endpoint integration
- Methods include:
  - `getTasks()` - with full query parameter support
  - `createTask()` - with validation
  - `updateTask()` - partial updates
  - `deleteTask()` - clean deletion
  - `toggleTaskCompletion()` - convenience method
  - `getTaskStats()` - statistics retrieval
  - `searchTasks()` - full-text search
  - `getTasksByStatus()` - status filtering
  - `getTasksByPriority()` - priority filtering
  - `bulkUpdateTasks()` - batch operations

### 3. State Management
Implemented comprehensive state management using React hooks:

#### Custom Hooks
- `useTasks` - Main hook for task management
  - Manages task list state
  - Handles loading and error states
  - Provides CRUD operations
  - Calculates local statistics
  - Supports filtering and sorting

- `useApi` - Generic API state management
  - Loading state tracking
  - Error handling
  - Data caching
  - Automatic cleanup

- `useTask` - Single task management
  - Individual task operations
  - Optimized for detail views

### 4. Responsive UI with Error Handling
Created a fully responsive UI with comprehensive error handling:

#### UI Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Dark Mode Support**: Ready for theme switching
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Loading States**: Spinners and skeleton screens
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry options
- **Notifications**: Toast-style success/error notifications
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion rate

#### Error Handling
- Network error detection with retry functionality
- Validation error display at field level
- Global error boundary for unexpected errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error dismissal
- Error logging for debugging

### 5. Testing
Comprehensive testing setup implemented:

#### Integration Tests (`/frontend/src/tests/integration/api.integration.test.js`)
- Tests all API endpoints
- Validates error handling
- Tests filtering and pagination
- Bulk operations testing
- Network error simulation

#### Manual Test Script (`/frontend/src/test-functionality.js`)
- Automated testing of all functionality
- Creates, reads, updates, and deletes tasks
- Tests validation and error handling
- Verifies statistics and bulk operations
- Includes cleanup procedures
