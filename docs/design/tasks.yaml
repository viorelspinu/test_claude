      - Documentation is clear and complete
      - Production configuration works
      - All environment variables are documented

# Task metadata
metadata:
  total_tasks: 29
  estimated_total_hours: 49.5
  development_phases:
    setup: 1
    backend: 8
    frontend: 18
    testing: 1
    documentation: 1
    integration: 1
  
  dependencies_summary:
    - Tasks 1-9: Backend development (sequential)
    - Tasks 10-27: Frontend development (mostly sequential with some parallelization possible)
    - Tasks 28-29: Testing and documentation (depends on all previous tasks)
  
  parallel_opportunities:
    - Tasks 10-11 can start after task 1 (frontend setup parallel to backend development)
    - Task 12 can start once backend API design is stable (after task 6)
    - Testing tasks can be implemented incrementally alongside development

  critical_path:
    - Backend setup and API development (tasks 1-9)
    - Frontend core components (tasks 13-18)
    - Bulk operations implementation (tasks 8, 19-20)
    - Integration and testing (tasks 28-29)

  new_features_added:
    - Bulk operations backend (task 8)
    - Enhanced statistics with overdue calculation (task 9)
    - Bulk selection UI (task 19)
    - Bulk operations frontend (task 20)
    - Split accessibility into separate task (task 27)

# Notes for implementation:
# 1. Each task should be fully completed and tested before moving to the next
# 2. Tasks can be broken down further if they exceed 2 hours of work
# 3. Regular integration testing should occur throughout development
# 4. Documentation should be updated incrementally with each task
# 5. Error handling and edge cases should be considered in every task
