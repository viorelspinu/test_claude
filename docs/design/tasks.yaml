# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "API integration complexity"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Start with simple endpoints and build incrementally"
  
  - risk: "State management complexity"
    impact: "low"
    mitigation: "Use React hooks and keep state simple initially"
  
  - risk: "Performance with large task lists"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Implement pagination and virtualization if needed"
  
  - risk: "Browser compatibility issues"
    impact: "low"
    mitigation: "Test on major browsers and use polyfills if needed"
