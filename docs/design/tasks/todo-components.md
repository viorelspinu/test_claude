# Todo Components Implementation Task

## Task ID
`task-014-todo-list-component`

## Title
Create TodoList component for displaying todos

## Description
Build the main component for displaying list of todos with basic styling and layout. This is the foundational component that will render the collection of todo items and handle the primary display logic for the todo application.

## Type
Frontend

## Dependencies
- `task-013-context-state-management` (React Context implementation must be completed)

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Priority
High - Core functionality required for todo display

## Acceptance Criteria
- TodoList component displays array of todos
- Empty state when no todos exist
- Loading state during API calls
- Error state for failed requests
- Basic responsive design

## Deliverables
- `/frontend/src/components/todo/TodoList.jsx` - Main todo list component
- Associated CSS modules for styling

## Test Requirements
- Component renders without errors
- Empty state displays correctly when no todos are present
- Loading and error states work appropriately
- Component integrates properly with TodoContext state management

## Implementation Notes
- Use the TodoContext for accessing todo state, loading states, and errors
- Implement proper conditional rendering for different states (loading, error, empty, populated)
- Ensure the component is prepared to receive and display todo items from the global state
- Apply basic responsive design principles for various screen sizes
- Follow React best practices for component structure and performance

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing TodoContext state management
- Should be ready to work with TodoItem components (to be implemented in next task)
- Keep styling modular and maintainable using CSS modules
- Ensure accessibility considerations are included in the basic implementation

## Success Metrics
- Component renders todos from context state correctly
- All state conditions (loading, error, empty, populated) display appropriately
- Component is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Code follows established React patterns and is maintainable
