# Frontend Setup Task

## Task ID
`task-010-frontend-project-setup`

## Title
Initialize React frontend with Vite and basic structure

## Description
Set up React project with Vite, install dependencies, and create basic component structure. This task establishes the foundation for the frontend application with modern tooling and a clean project structure.

## Type
Frontend

## Dependencies
- `task-001-project-setup` (completed)

## Estimated Time
1.5 hours

## Priority
High (foundational task)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React 18+ project created with Vite
- [ ] All required dependencies installed (axios, date-fns, etc.)
- [ ] Basic component directory structure
- [ ] Development server starts successfully
- [ ] Basic routing setup with React Router

## Deliverables
- `/frontend/src/` directory with component structure
- `/frontend/package.json` with all dependencies
- `/frontend/vite.config.js` configured

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Basic React app renders in browser
- [ ] Hot module replacement works

## Technical Requirements

### Required Dependencies
Install the following packages:
- React 18+ (react, react-dom)
- React Router (react-router-dom)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- date-fns for date manipulation
- CSS modules support (built into Vite)

### Directory Structure
Create the following directory structure:
```
/frontend/src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── todo/
├── context/
├── services/
├── styles/
├── utils/
├── App.jsx
└── main.jsx
```

### Vite Configuration
- Configure Vite for React
- Set up proper dev server port (typically 3000)
- Enable hot module replacement
- Configure path aliases if needed

## Constraints
- Use Vite as the build tool (not Create React App)
- Use React 18+ with modern patterns
- Ensure compatibility with backend API (CORS considerations)
- Set up for development environment initially

## Success Metrics
- Development server starts in under 5 seconds
- React application loads without console errors
- Hot reload works for component changes
- Project structure follows established conventions

## Notes
- This task sets up the foundation for all subsequent frontend tasks
- Ensure proper package management with package-lock.json
- Consider future scalability in the component structure
- Verify compatibility with the backend CORS configuration
