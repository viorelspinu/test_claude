# Task: Backend Core Setup

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: task-002-backend-core-setup
- **Title**: Setup Flask application core and database connection
- **Type**: backend
- **Dependencies**: ["task-001-project-setup"]
- **Estimated Hours**: 2

## Description
Initialize Flask app, configure SQLAlchemy, and establish database connection with basic configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Flask app factory pattern implemented
- SQLAlchemy ORM configured and connected
- Database configuration for development environment
- Basic error handling and logging setup
- Health check endpoint responding

## Deliverables
- `/backend/app/__init__.py` with Flask app factory
- `/backend/config.py` with environment configurations
- `/backend/run.py` for application startup

## Test Requirements
- Flask app starts successfully
- Database connection established
- Health check endpoint returns 200 status

## Implementation Notes
This task establishes the foundational backend infrastructure that all subsequent backend tasks will build upon. The Flask app factory pattern is essential for proper configuration management and testing.

## Priority
High - This is a foundational task that blocks all subsequent backend development.

## Dependencies
Must be completed after task-001-project-setup which establishes the basic project structure and directories.
