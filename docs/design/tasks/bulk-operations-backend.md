# Task: Implement Bulk Operations API Endpoints

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: task-008-bulk-operations-backend
- **Title**: Implement bulk operations API endpoints
- **Type**: backend
- **Dependencies**: ["task-007-cors-security-setup"]
- **Estimated Hours**: 2

## Description
Create backend endpoints for bulk delete and bulk status update operations with proper validation and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] /api/todos/bulk endpoint implemented for POST requests
- [ ] Support for bulk delete operation (max 50 items)
- [ ] Support for bulk status update (mark complete/pending)
- [ ] Proper validation of todo_ids array and operation type
- [ ] Rollback capability for partially failed operations
- [ ] Progress tracking for operations > 10 items
- [ ] Detailed error reporting per item

## Deliverables
- [ ] `/backend/app/routes/bulk_operations.py` with bulk endpoints
- [ ] Bulk operation service logic in todo_service.py
- [ ] Input validation schemas for bulk operations

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Bulk delete removes all specified todos
- [ ] Bulk status update works correctly
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid operations
- [ ] Error handling works for partial failures
- [ ] Performance meets 10-second requirement

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoint Design
```
POST /api/todos/bulk
```

### Request Format
```json
{
  "operation": "delete" | "mark_complete" | "mark_pending",
  "todo_ids": [1, 2, 3, ...],
  "options": {
    "track_progress": boolean
  }
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "operation": string,
  "processed_count": number,
  "failed_count": number,
  "results": [
    {
      "todo_id": number,
      "success": boolean,
      "error": string | null
    }
  ],
  "progress_id": string | null
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Validation Requirements**:
   - Maximum 50 items per bulk operation
   - Validate that all todo_ids exist and belong to valid todos
   - Validate operation type is one of: "delete", "mark_complete", "mark_pending"

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Use database transactions to ensure atomicity
   - Implement rollback for partially failed operations
   - Provide detailed error messages for each failed item
   - Handle database connection errors gracefully

3. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Operations must complete within 10 seconds
   - Use batch processing for database operations
   - Implement progress tracking for operations > 10 items

4. **Service Layer Integration**:
   - Extend existing TodoService class with bulk operation methods
   - Maintain consistency with existing CRUD operations
   - Follow established error handling patterns

## Priority
**High** - This feature is critical for user productivity with large numbers of todos.

## Notes
- This task builds upon the existing todo service architecture
- Progress tracking may require additional state management for larger operations
- Consider implementing soft delete for bulk delete operations to maintain data integrity
- Ensure proper logging for audit trails of bulk operations
