# 008 · Task 001 Review: Flask Backend Structure Setup

## Overall Status: PASS ✓

## Acceptance Criteria Review

### ✓ PASS: `/backend/` directory created
- Directory structure properly established
- Files located at correct paths

### ✓ PASS: `app.py` with basic Flask app initialization
- Flask application properly initialized with `Flask(__name__)`
- Clean, readable code structure
- Proper imports from flask and flask_cors

### ✓ PASS: `requirements.txt` with Flask and Flask-CORS dependencies
- Flask==2.3.3 included
- Flask-CORS==4.0.0 included
- Additional SQLAlchemy==2.0.23 for future database needs (good forward planning)

### ✓ PASS: CORS configured for frontend communication
- CORS properly imported and configured with `CORS(app)`
- Will enable cross-origin requests from frontend

### ✓ PASS: App runs successfully on localhost:8080
- Configuration updated to port 8080 per conventions (was originally 5000 in task spec)
- Host set to '0.0.0.0' for accessibility
- Debug mode enabled for development

### ✓ PASS: Returns basic "Hello World" or status endpoint
- Root endpoint `/` returns structured JSON with app info
- Additional `/api/status` endpoint provides API status
- Both endpoints return proper JSON responses

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Clean, readable code structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Good JSON response structure with meaningful data
- Forward-looking endpoint documentation in status response
- Proper Flask application pattern

### Minor Observations
- Task originally specified port 5000 but implementation correctly uses port 8080 per updated conventions
- SQLAlchemy added proactively for future database needs

## Test Results Analysis
- All 5 automated tests passed
- Flask app imports without errors
- CORS configuration verified
- Route definitions confirmed
- Port configuration matches requirements
- Dependencies properly installed

## Recommendation

**APPROVE** - Task 001 successfully completed. The Flask backend structure is properly established and ready for API development.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 002 (API route implementation)
- Backend foundation is solid and follows project conventions
- Ready for todo CRUD endpoints implementation

## Issues Found
None - implementation meets all acceptance criteria and follows best practices.
