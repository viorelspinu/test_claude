# 004 · Architecture Review (Architect B)

## Review of Architect A's Design

### Strengths
- Clear separation between backend and frontend
- Appropriate technology choices (Flask + React)
- Well-defined API contract
- Incremental task breakdown
- SQLite suitable for development/demo purposes

### Concerns and Adjustments

#### 1. Project Structure
**Issue:** Backend and frontend both in `/src/` may cause confusion
**Suggestion:** Use separate root directories:
- `/backend/` for Flask app
- `/frontend/` for React app

#### 2. CORS Configuration
**Missing:** Explicit CORS setup required for local development
**Addition:** Add Flask-CORS configuration to task 001

#### 3. Task Dependencies
**Issue:** Task 005 (React setup) has no dependencies but should wait for backend API structure
**Suggestion:** Keep parallel development but add API testing task

#### 4. Error Handling
**Issue:** Error handling relegated to final task
**Suggestion:** Add basic error handling earlier in API development

### Proposed Architecture Updates

#### Updated Project Structure
```
/backend/
├── app.py
├── models.py  
├── routes.py
├── database.py
├── requirements.txt
└── todos.db

/frontend/
├── public/
├── src/
├── package.json
└── build/
```

#### Additional Tasks Needed
- Add CORS configuration
- Add basic API testing/validation
- Add environment configuration

### Approval Status
**APPROVED with minor adjustments** - Proceed with updated structure and task refinements.
