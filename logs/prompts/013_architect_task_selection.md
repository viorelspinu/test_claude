# 013 - Architect Task Selection

## Role: Architect  
## Objective: Select next minimal viable task

## Current State
- Task 1: Flask backend setup ✅ COMPLETE
- Task 2: Todo model and database ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED

## Available Tasks
From tasks.yaml, next available tasks with satisfied dependencies:
- Task 3: Implement GET todos API endpoint (depends on task 2 ✅)
- Task 6: Setup React frontend structure (no dependencies)

## Decision Criteria
- Smallest unit of work that visibly moves project forward
- Backend-first approach maintains logical progression
- API endpoints needed before frontend can consume them

## Selected Task: Task 3
**Implement GET todos API endpoint**

## Rationale
1. Natural progression from database model to API consumption
2. Creates visible, testable functionality 
3. Minimal scope - single endpoint with clear success criteria
4. Enables immediate testing and validation
5. Required foundation for frontend development
