# 004 - Architect B Review

## Review of Initial Architecture

### Strengths
- Clear separation of concerns between backend and frontend
- Logical task breakdown with proper dependencies
- Standard Flask and React patterns
- Appropriate technology choices for a todo app

### Recommendations
1. **Database Location**: Move SQLite to backend root, not instance/
2. **API Versioning**: Consider /api/v1/ prefix for future extensibility
3. **Environment Setup**: Add environment configuration files
4. **Task Granularity**: Task 1 could be split - Flask setup vs requirements
5. **CORS Setup**: Ensure CORS is explicitly handled in task planning

### Proposed Adjustments
- Add explicit CORS configuration task
- Include environment setup as separate task
- Consider adding basic logging setup
- Add task for API documentation

### Consensus Decision
The architecture is sound for a basic todo app. The task roadmap provides a logical progression from backend to frontend integration. Minor adjustments noted above can be incorporated during implementation.

**Architecture Approved** - Proceeding to execution phase.
