# 013 · Architect Task Selection 003

**Role:** Architect (Task Selection)
**Previous Task:** 002 - Create Todo API Routes (COMPLETED & REVIEWED)

**Current State:**
- Flask backend structure established
- API routes functional with hardcoded data  
- CRUD endpoints operational and tested
- Ready for database integration or frontend development

**Available Tasks:** From `/docs/design/tasks.yaml`
- 003: Setup Database Models (depends on 001) ✓ Ready
- 004: Integrate Database with API (depends on 002, 003) - Needs 003 first
- 005: Setup React Frontend Structure (no dependencies) ✓ Ready

**Selection Decision:** Task 005 - Setup React Frontend Structure
**Reasoning:** Build frontend parallel to backend, test API integration early, avoid database complexity before frontend validation

**Output:** Extract to `/logs/tasks/005_react_setup.md`
