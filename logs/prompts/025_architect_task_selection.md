# 025 - Architect Task Selection

## Role: Architect  
## Objective: Select next minimal viable task

## Current State
- Task 1: Flask backend setup ✅ COMPLETE
- Task 2: Todo model and database ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED  
- Task 3: GET todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 4: POST todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 6: React frontend structure ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED

## Available Tasks Analysis
From tasks.yaml, available tasks with satisfied dependencies:
- Task 5: PUT/DELETE todos endpoints (depends on tasks 3,4 ✅)
- Task 7: TodoList component (depends on tasks 6,3 ✅)
- Task 8: AddTodo component (depends on tasks 6,4 ✅)

## Decision Criteria
- Frontend components are already created but need API integration
- Current implementation has placeholder functionality
- Testing full stack integration is valuable
- TodoList (Task 7) would demonstrate GET endpoint integration
- AddTodo (Task 8) would demonstrate POST endpoint integration

## Strategic Analysis
Tasks 7 and 8 appear redundant since components were already created in Task 6. However, the task definitions likely refer to connecting these components to the actual API, not just creating them.

## Selected Task: Task 7
**Create TodoList component** (Interpreted as: Connect TodoList to live API)

## Rationale
1. **Integration Testing**: Validates frontend-backend communication
2. **Visible Progress**: Shows real data from database
3. **Minimal Scope**: GET integration is simpler than POST
4. **Foundation Building**: Confirms API connectivity before POST operations
5. **User Value**: Immediately demonstrates working application

## Task Reinterpretation
Since components exist, this task involves:
- Ensuring TodoList fetches real data from backend
- Testing cross-origin requests (CORS)
- Validating end-to-end data flow
- Confirming both servers can run simultaneously
