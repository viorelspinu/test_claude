# 005 - Architect Task Selection

## Next Task Selection

### Current Status
- Architecture approved by both Architect A and B
- Ready to begin incremental execution loop
- No tasks completed yet

### Task Analysis
From tasks.yaml, the following tasks have no dependencies:
- Task 1: Setup Flask backend structure
- Task 6: Setup React frontend structure

### Decision Rationale
Starting with Task 1 (Flask backend) because:
1. Backend provides the data foundation
2. API endpoints can be tested independently
3. Frontend will depend on backend API being available
4. Follows typical full-stack development flow

### Selected Task
**Task 1: Setup Flask backend structure**
- Create Flask app with basic structure and requirements
- Set up project directory
- Create requirements.txt
- Initialize basic Flask application

### Next Steps
1. Extract task to current.md
2. Developer implements task
3. Tester validates
4. Reviewer audits
5. Return to Architect for next task selection
