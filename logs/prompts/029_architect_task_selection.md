# 029 - Architect Task Selection

## Role: Architect  
## Objective: Select next minimal viable task

## Current State
- Task 1: Flask backend setup ✅ COMPLETE
- Task 2: Todo model and database ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED  
- Task 3: GET todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 4: POST todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 6: React frontend structure ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 7: TodoList integration ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED

## Available Tasks Analysis
From tasks.yaml, available tasks with satisfied dependencies:
- Task 5: PUT/DELETE todos endpoints (depends on tasks 3,4 ✅)
- Task 8: AddTodo component (depends on tasks 6,4 ✅)
- Task 9: Todo toggle/delete UI (depends on tasks 7,5 - partially met)

## Decision Criteria
- Task 8 (AddTodo) would complete basic CRUD UI functionality
- Integration already proven with Task 7
- POST endpoint exists and tested
- AddTodo component created but needs integration verification
- Enables users to create todos through UI

## Selected Task: Task 8
**Create AddTodo component** (Interpreted as: Verify AddTodo POST integration)

## Rationale
1. **Completes Core Loop**: GET (Task 7) + POST (Task 8) = functional app
2. **User Value**: Enables todo creation through UI
3. **Minimal Scope**: POST integration already prepared
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Builds on proven integration
5. **Immediate Usability**: App becomes interactive

## Task Interpretation
Since AddTodo component exists from Task 6, this task involves:
- Verifying POST requests from frontend to backend
- Testing todo creation through UI
- Confirming real-time list updates
- Validating form submission and error handling

## Task Extraction
