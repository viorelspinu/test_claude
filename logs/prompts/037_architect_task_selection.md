## Available Tasks Analysis
From tasks.yaml, remaining tasks:

## Decision Criteria
- Task 9 dependencies are now satisfied
- UI for toggle/delete completes core functionality
- Enables full CRUD operations from frontend
- Natural progression after backend completion
- Task 10 requires Task 9 completion

## Selected Task: Task 9
**Add todo toggle and delete functionality**

## Rationale
1. **Complete User Experience**: Adds ability to mark todos complete and remove them
2. **Dependency Satisfaction**: Both Task 7 and Task 5 are complete
3. **Visible Value**: Users can manage todo lifecycle fully
4. **Integration Focus**: Connects UI to PUT/DELETE endpoints
5. **Foundation for Task 10**: Last requirement before error handling task

## Implementation Scope
- Add toggle button/checkbox for completed status
- Add delete button for each todo
- Connect to PUT endpoint for status updates
- Connect to DELETE endpoint for removal
- Update UI state after operations
- Handle loading/error states
