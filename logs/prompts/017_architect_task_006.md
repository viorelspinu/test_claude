# 017 · Architect Task Selection 006

**Role:** Architect (Task Selection)
**Previous Task:** 005 - Setup React Frontend Structure (COMPLETED & REVIEWED)

**Current State:**
- Flask backend with API routes (hardcoded data)
- React frontend with complete component structure
- API service configured for backend communication
- Both systems tested and functional independently

**Available Tasks:** From `/docs/design/tasks.yaml`
- 003: Setup Database Models (depends on 001) ✓ Ready
- 004: Integrate Database with API (depends on 002, 003) - Needs 003 first
- 006: Create Todo Components (depends on 005) ✓ Ready - **ALREADY COMPLETED**
- 007: Setup API Service (depends on 005) ✓ Ready - **ALREADY COMPLETED**
- 008: Connect Frontend to Backend (depends on 006, 007, 004) - Needs database integration
- 009: Add Todo Filtering (depends on 008) - Later
- 010: Error Handling and Polish (depends on 008) - Later

**Re-evaluation:** Tasks 006 and 007 were completed as part of Task 005 implementation. Current priority is connecting frontend to backend.

**Selection Decision:** Task 008 - Connect Frontend to Backend (modified to work with current hardcoded API)
**Reasoning:** Test full-stack integration before adding database complexity, validate API communication works end-to-end

**Output:** Extract modified Task 008 to `/logs/tasks/008_frontend_backend_integration.md`
