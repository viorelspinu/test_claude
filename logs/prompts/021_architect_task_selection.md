# 021 - Architect Task Selection

## Role: Architect  
## Objective: Select next minimal viable task

## Current State
- Task 1: Flask backend setup ✅ COMPLETE
- Task 2: Todo model and database ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED  
- Task 3: GET todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED
- Task 4: POST todos endpoint ✅ COMPLETE & APPROVED

## Available Tasks
From tasks.yaml, next available tasks with satisfied dependencies:
- Task 5: PUT/DELETE todos endpoints (depends on tasks 3,4 ✅)
- Task 6: Setup React frontend structure (no dependencies)

## Decision Criteria
- Core backend CRUD functionality vs frontend initialization
- Task 6 (React frontend) enables parallel development streams
- Frontend can start consuming existing GET/POST endpoints immediately
- Smallest viable increment for visible progress
- Creates foundation for user interface development

## Selected Task: Task 6
**Setup React frontend structure**

## Rationale
1. **Parallel Development Path**: Enables frontend work while backend can continue
2. **Immediate Value**: Can demonstrate GET/POST endpoints through UI
3. **User-Visible Progress**: Frontend structure shows tangible user-facing progress
4. **Minimal Viable Scope**: Basic React setup with component structure
5. **Dependency Management**: No backend dependencies, can proceed independently

## Strategic Consideration
Backend has solid foundation (GET/POST), frontend can now consume these endpoints while additional backend features (PUT/DELETE) can be added later based on frontend requirements.
