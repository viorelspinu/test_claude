# Task 007: TodoList Component API Integration

## Objective
Ensure TodoList component successfully fetches and displays todos from the backend API.

## Context
Components were created in Task 6, but full integration testing is needed to verify end-to-end functionality.

## Requirements
- TodoList fetches data from GET /api/todos endpoint
- Backend server runs on port 8080
- Frontend dev server runs on available port
- CORS allows cross-origin requests
- Error handling for connection failures
- Loading states during data fetch

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Both servers run simultaneously without conflicts
2. ✅ TodoList displays todos from database
3. ✅ Empty state shows when no todos exist
4. ✅ Loading state displays during fetch
5. ✅ Error handling for API failures
6. ✅ CORS configuration working properly

## Implementation Plan
1. Start backend server on port 8080
2. Start frontend dev server
3. Verify API connectivity
4. Test with existing todos in database
5. Test error scenarios
6. Document any configuration adjustments needed

## Testing Strategy
- Run both servers concurrently
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify network requests in dev tools
- Test with populated and empty database
- Simulate API failures

## Definition of Done
- TodoList displays real todos from database
- No CORS errors in browser console
- Proper loading and error states
- Both servers running stably
- Ready for full user interaction
