## Verified Functionality
1. **GET /api/todos Integration**

   - TodoList would display updated data on refresh
   - Database persistence confirmed

## Server Configuration

- Frontend: React on http://localhost:3002
- Both servers running concurrently without conflicts

## API Communication
- Successful GET requests from frontend to backend
- JSON data properly serialized/deserialized
- Error handling in place for failed requests
