# 006 - DELETE Todos Endpoint Report

## Task Completed
Implemented DELETE /api/todos/<id> endpoint to remove todos.

## Implementation Summary
- Added DELETE /api/todos/<id> endpoint with integer ID parameter
- Finds existing todo by ID or returns 404 if not found
- Deletes todo from database using SQLAlchemy session
- Returns HTTP 204 No Content on successful deletion
- Proper error handling for non-existent todo IDs

## Files Modified
- `backend/app/routes.py` - Added DELETE endpoint

## Visible Effect
Can delete todos via API - they are permanently removed from database and no longer appear in GET requests.
