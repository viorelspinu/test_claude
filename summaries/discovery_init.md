# Discovery Analysis - Initial Project Setup

## Task Completion Status
✅ **Directory Structure Created Successfully**

### Created Directories:
- `/logs/` - For prompt logging (already contained `/logs/prompts/discovery_init_1.md`)
- `/docs/requirements/` - For requirements documentation
- `/docs/design/` - For design documentation  
- `/src/` - For implementation code
- `/summaries/` - For task summaries
- `/reviews/` - For code reviews
- `/tests/reports/` - For test results

## Existing Project State Analysis

### Current Project Structure:
```
/Users/viorel/workspace/test_claude/
├── CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
├── docs/
│   ├── design/
│   └── requirements/
├── logs/
│   └── prompts/
│       └── discovery_init_1.md
├── reviews/

    └── reports/
```

### Frontend Directory Analysis:
- **Status**: NOT FOUND
- **Expected Location**: `/frontend/` with `node_modules/` subdirectory
- **Current State**: The directory structure snapshot mentioned `frontend/node_modules/` but this directory does not exist in the current project
- **Implication**: Frontend React application has not been initialized yet

### Key Findings:
1. **Project is in initial state** - No existing code implementation
2. **Orchestrator structure is ready** - All required directories for the agent workflow are now in place
3. **Frontend needs initialization** - React frontend will need to be created from scratch
4. **Backend needs creation** - Flask backend directory structure not present
5. **Git repository status**: Not a git repository (as noted in environment info)

### Next Steps Recommended:
1. Requirements gathering for Todo application features
2. Architecture planning for Flask backend and React frontend integration
3. Frontend React app initialization
4. Backend Flask app setup

## Technical Environment:
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 23.5.0)
- Working Directory: `/Users/viorel/workspace/test_claude/`
- Git Status: Not a git repository
