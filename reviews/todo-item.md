## Code Quality Review

### React Component Structure and Patterns
✅ **Excellent** - The component follows React best practices:
- Functional component with proper hooks usage
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated event handlers
- Proper state management using `useState` for local UI state (isDeleting)
- Good use of destructuring for props and context values
- Memoized calculations for derived state (isOverdue, priorityClass)

### PropTypes Validation and Error Handling
✅ **Complete** - PropTypes validation is comprehensive:
- All required props are properly defined
- Complex shape validation for todo object with all fields
- Proper type validation for callback functions
- Enum validation for priority and status fields
- Error handling present in delete operation with try-catch

### CSS Module Styling and Visual Design
✅ **Outstanding** - Exceptional styling implementation:
- CSS modules properly configured and imported
- Comprehensive styling for all component states
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Excellent hover states and visual feedback
- Clean, professional visual hierarchy
- Proper use of CSS custom properties for maintainability

### Component Reusability and Maintainability
✅ **Very Good** - Highly reusable component:
- Pure functional component with no side effects
- Clear prop interface for parent communication
- Well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Modular styling with CSS modules
- Good separation between presentation and business logic

### Integration with Existing Components
✅ **Seamless** - Perfect integration:
- Properly integrated with TodoContext for bulk selection
- Works perfectly with TodoList component
- Consistent with existing component patterns
- Proper event handler delegation to parent

## Specification Compliance

### Display Requirements
✅ **All Met**:
- Title, description, priority, and due date are displayed correctly
- Clean layout with proper information hierarchy
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

- Low priority: Green background (#28a745)
- Clear visual distinction between priority levels

### Overdue Items Highlighting
✅ **Working as Specified**:
- Correct logic: due_date < current_date AND status = 'pending'
- Red left border for overdue items
- Warning icon (⚠️) displayed next to due date
- Light red background tint (#fff5f5)
- Excludes items due today (proper date comparison)

### TodoContext Integration
✅ **Fully Integrated**:
- Uses `useTodo` hook to access context

## Technical Assessment

### Component Performance and Optimization
✅ **Good Performance**:
- Efficient re-rendering patterns
- No unnecessary state updates

### Mobile Responsiveness
✅ **Fully Responsive**:
- Breakpoints at 768px and 480px
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile
- Proper layout adjustments for small screens
- Text wrapping and overflow handling

### State Management Patterns
✅ **Clean Implementation**:
- Minimal local state (only isDeleting)
- Proper delegation to parent for data mutations
- Good separation between UI state and data state
- Optimistic UI updates through parent handlers

### Integration with TodoList
✅ **Perfect Integration**:
- Props interface matches TodoList expectations
- Event handlers properly connected
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Works seamlessly with bulk operations

## Issues and Recommendations

### Issues Found
**None** - No bugs or critical issues identified

### Minor Improvements (Optional)
1. **Performance**: Consider wrapping component in `React.memo` for large lists
2. **Animations**: The delete animation could be slightly smoother
3. **Icons**: Consider using icon library instead of emojis for better consistency
4. **Date Formatting**: Could add relative date display (e.g., "2 days ago")

### Missing Functionality
**None** - All required functionality is implemented

### Edge Cases Handled
✅ Missing description field
✅ Invalid date formats
✅ Network errors during operations
✅ Rapid clicking prevention
✅ Long text overflow
